# aphorism-processing
Contains the basic text and scripts used to create the [Sayings, Aphorisms, and Maxims](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenbbooth/aphorisms-and-maxims) dataset. The text file was initially downloaded from Project Gutenberg, but has been manually cleaned of offensive and malformed entries.
